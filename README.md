# Snake Game with JavaScript Objects

This is a simple snake game made with JavaScript objects. The game is played on a 10x10 grid and the snake grows by 1 each time it eats the food. The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or itself.

The game is made with JavaScript objects and uses the `canvas` element to draw the game. It also uses the `requestAnimationFrame` method to update the game. This should help understand how to use JavaScript objects and the `canvas` element to create a simple game.
